 <title>Summary</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>The brief example in this paper illustrates how you can use keys and the keyref facility to
            increase your reuse possibilities without increasing inter-topic dependencies. Using the
            technique described, you can externalize the context-related content. By separating the
            context from the context in this way, you increase flexibility, minimize the effort
            spent managing that content, and facilitate the production of multiple different outputs
            from a single DITA map.</p>
