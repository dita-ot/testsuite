<title>Taxonomy specialization</title>
<shortdesc>The Taxonomy specialization supports semantic classification of
content.</shortdesc>
<refbody>
<section><title>Description</title><?Pub Caret1?><p>You take the following
approach:</p><ol>
<li>Define the subject matter for your content by writing <xref href="subjectDomain/subject-d_module.xml"
type="reference">subject topics</xref>. In effect, these topics define a single
sense of a term from a glossary. </li>
<li>Define relationships between these subjects with a <xref href="mapScheme/scheme_module.xml"
type="reference">scheme map</xref>.</li>
<li>Classify your content by specifying relationships between content topics
and these subject topics in your <xref href="classifyDomain/classify-d_module.xml"
type="reference">navigation map</xref>.</li>
</ol><note>This specialization conforms closely to the SKOS standard, which
(though largely stable) hasn't progressed to full approval yet. Because of
that, it is possible that this specialization could change in the future if
SKOS changes during approval. The RDF output generated from this specialization
is more likely to change than the markup itself. For more information about
SKOS, see <xref format="html" href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core/">http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core/</xref>.</note></section>
