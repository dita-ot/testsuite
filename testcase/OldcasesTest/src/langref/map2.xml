         <p>A map describes the relationships among a set of DITA topics. The following
are some examples of relationships that can be described in a map:<indexterm>Map
elements</indexterm>
         
         </p>
         <ul>

            
            <li>Hierarchical (Parent/Child). Nested topics create a hierarchical relationship.
The topic that does the nesting is the parent, and the topics that are nested
are the children.</li>

            
            <li>Ordered. Child topics can be labeled as having an ordered relationship,
which means they are referenced in a definite sequence.</li>

            
            <li>Family. Child topics can be labeled as having a family relationship, which
means they all refer to each other.</li>

         
         </ul>
         <p>The relationships defined in a map can be used to create a Table of Contents
(TOC), aggregate topics into a PDF document, or to create links between topics
in output.</p>
