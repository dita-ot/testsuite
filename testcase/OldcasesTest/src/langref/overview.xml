    <section>
      <p>The design of the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) is based on deriving multiple information types, or <i>
          <apiname>info-types</apiname>
        </i>, from a common, generic topic. This language reference describes the elements that comprise the topic DTD and its initial, info-typed descendents: concept, reference, and task.<indexterm>DITA Language Reference overview</indexterm></p>
      <p>The elements that make up the DITA design represent a set of different authoring concerns:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The main components of a topic, concept, reference, or task document,</li>
        <li>The common elements available for creating content within the body of a topic,</li>
        <li>The elements that make up the two types of tables in DITA,</li>
        <li>Elements that represent different subject domains,</li>
        <li>Elements that appear in many contexts,</li>
        <li>The elements contained in the prolog of a topic,</li>
        <li>The elements contained in the related-links part of a topic,</li>
        <li>Elements that are available for further specialization,</li>
        <li>Commonly referenced descriptions,</li>
        <li>and elements contained in a DITA map.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, this reference also describes elements that are used to manage DITA topics, either for convenience in editing or for production as sets of topics for particular kinds of deliverables.</p>
