         <p>The related-links section of DITA topics is a special structure that supports
the navigational rules from a topic to its related neighbor topics, whether
parent/child relationships (hierarchy), sibling relationships (browse sequences),
types (collections), and whether the link is internal or external to the set.<indexterm>Related
Links elements</indexterm>
         
         </p>
         <p>Links are different from cross-references in that cross-references occur
only within the body of a topic and can target any element in this or other
topics; links only represent topic-to-topic connections.</p>
