         <p>Several parts of a language reference are common between many
locations, such as the descriptions for the selection and property attributes
of DITA elements. These are described as sets to reduce unnecessary duplication
of common information. The technique you use to reference this common information
within the various topics of this language reference is a model for how you
can likewise maintain oft-reused information in a single location. <indexterm>Commonly
