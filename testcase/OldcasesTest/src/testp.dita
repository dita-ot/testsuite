<p>this is a paragraph with no attributes -- I surely hope it works, if not
we've got some major problems. Let's add some text now to make things wrap
(bet you can't guess where it's from): You may have had a few "heart palpitations"
in your love life recently, dear Libra. But too much is too much, and today
you may feel like cooling down a bit. During this period of time, were you
able to unveil the best aspects of your personality? Were you respectful of
the people that were attracted to you? Try not to lose the benefits of all
that great energy that surrounded you the past few days.</p>
