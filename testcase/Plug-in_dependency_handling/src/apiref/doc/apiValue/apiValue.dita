<shortdesc>The &lt;apiValue&gt; element specifies a collection futures, such
as constants, variables, enumerations, structures, or other named
values.</shortdesc>
<refbody>
<section><title>Description</title><p>This element requires an ID attribute
as an anchor point. This ID is the target for references by &lt;link&gt; , &lt;xref&gt;,
or other internal specialization type elements that refer to the &lt;apiRef&gt;
element content (conref and keyref attributes). Use a unique key such as fully
qualified classifier name for the named API reference. For instance, the full
name of a method contains the method name that is qualified by the name of
the class that provides the method and by the name of the package that, in
turn, provides the class. You provide the name in the API reference topic.
The fully qualified name is generated based on the API items that contain
this item. </p></section>
