as entered. However, there are also types of information that are usually
authored in context with a thought or issue, but upon output, the content
might be relocated, suppressed, or used only for purposes such as inline annotations
for drafts. These elements include footnotes, index entries, draft comments,
and special cleanup containers that can hold migrated data that still needs
a writer's intervention to get into the right place.<indexterm class="- topic/indexterm ">Miscellaneous
